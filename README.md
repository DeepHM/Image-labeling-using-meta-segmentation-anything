## Getting Started
- for meta-segmentation-anything

The (meta-segmentation-anything)code requires python>=3.8, as well as pytorch>=1.7 and torchvision>=0.8. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) or [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.
